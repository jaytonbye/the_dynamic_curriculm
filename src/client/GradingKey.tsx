      <p>
        A grade of 1 means the wrestler needs a lot of work on the move. The
        coach should review their ones with them each lesson
      </p>
      <p>
        A grade of 2 means the wrestler has a decent grasp of the move, but is
        still working on a few details.
      </p>
      <p>
        A grade of 3 means the wrestler knows the movement by its name and can
        demonstrate it perfectly without hesitation. If a wrestler needs any
        help whatsoever, or got any of the details incorrect, they will not
        receive a 3.
